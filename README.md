# Rijks Rijksmusea search website - Rijksmuseum Server
 
 <b>Disclaimer:</b>
 The application is hosted for free on heroku, and may takes a while to load properly.<br/>
 <br/>
 Website: https://rijksm.herokuapp.com <br/>
 Github Frontend: https://github.com/Nightfly-student/Rijksmuseum-frontend <br/>
 Anagrams assignment: https://rijksm.herokuapp.com/anagrams.html <br/>
 
 The website is made in Vite + ExpressJs + Monogdb as a internship entrance assignment for Endeavor. <br/>
 The time it took me to make this project is 11.5 hours <br/>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 ### The Process of making this project
 
I started with finding a design that would fit this application. I took inspiration on the rijksmuseum room colors, these are light/dark purple greyish. I used this pallete to create the website. <br/>
 
You may notice that it gives the feeling that you are standing infront of a painting, this was my main focus during the design.<br/>
 
The difficulties I faced where creating a observer to make an infinte scroll, and checking the main color of a picture and see if the color exists in one of the art pieces in rijksmuseum api database. <br/>

 -----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
  ### What Can I Do in the application
  
  1. Search through the huge database of rijksmuseum with advanced filters to find art <br/>
  2. Read about 6 of the famous artists that hang in the Rijksmuseum <br/>
  3. Learn more about a painting <br/>
  
 -----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   ### What is Next?
   
  If you hire me to be an intern, I will try to follow some courses on typescript and angular during the summer break<br/>
  
  Thanks for the opportunity and for a fun project.
